There are different hardware designs for the sticks.
Make sure that the extension board fits your stick.

Stick1_jr1 is based on:

I highly recommend the optocoupler version. It is not very likely that you will actually need it, but
if you do have a motherboard, that needs it, it will save you a lot of debugging effort.

If you like a tiny design, have a look at https://github.com/Sl-Alex/IRMP_STM32_MINI and at
