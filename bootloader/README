The bootloaders are locted in [1], [2] and [3].

The firmware, which gets loaded by the bootloader, has to make an USB reset for 
re-enumeration. For this compile the firmware with "make Bootloader=1".

Once the bootloader is flashed, you flash the new firmware like this:
First run /path/FlashDFUxxx.sh /path/newFirmware.bin,
then (re)connect or reset or reboot the board.

I made a patch for dfu-util, which lets's dfu-util loop, so this no longer needs to be done in a script.
dfu-util git contains that patch [4].
