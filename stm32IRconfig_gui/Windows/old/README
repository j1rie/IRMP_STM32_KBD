Old way: 
Get hidapi-externals from https://github.com/downloads/signal11/hidapi/hidapi-externals.zip
Put the content of this folder into the directory hidapi, which has to be parallel to
hidapi-externals, so that both are in the same parent directory.

New way:
Build with libs fox-1.6.50 or fox-1.7.51, libpng-1.6.17 and zlib-1.2.8.
Those need to be in the folder external-libs.
Put the content of this folder into a directory, which has to be parallel to
external-libs, so that both are in the same parent directory.
