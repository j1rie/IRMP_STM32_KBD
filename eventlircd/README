For automatic start and stop of eventlircd during boot and on device dis/reconnect
put the udev rule '70-irmp.rules' into your udev rules directory (/etc/udev/rules.d/),
put the udev rule '98-eventlircd.rules' into your udev rules directory (/etc/udev/rules.d/),
put the evmap '03_1209_4445.evmap' into your evmap directory (/usr/etc/eventlircd.d/),
put the systemd service 'eventlircd.service' into your services directory (/etc/systemd/system/),
put the systemd service 'eventlircd.socket' into your services directory (/etc/systemd/system/),
put the systemd-tmpfiles config file 'eventlircd.conf' into your tmpfiles directory (/etc/tmpfiles.d/),
and run "systemctl enable eventlircd.service eventlircd.socket" once.

If you build your own kernel, you may patch it with hid_irmp.diff, with that repeats work perfectly, when
repeat_timeout is set to e.g. 130.
It may be necessary to put 'rmmod hid_irmp', 'rmmod hid_generic' and 'modprobe hid_irmp' in /etc/init.d/boot.local (look
for "irmp configured" in dmesg).
Without the patch you need to have repeat_timeout set to 0, and all key presses are new keys, so
long key presses in kodi are not working.
