Does a keyboard remote control receiver work ootb or does it need additional software?

Many people think, a remote control receiver registering itself as a keyboard does not need  additional software, but that‘s wrong.
For a  keyboard remote control receiver without  additional software has either fake trailing keypresses or a long keypress is detected as multiple single ones.
If you accept that, than of course you don‘t need  additional software.

A keyboard sends key-press and key-release,and the repeat is not generated by the keyboard, but by the kernel‘s autorepeat function.
After press you get autorepeats until release.
A remote control sends a signal periodically, but no release.
Therefore the release get generated by the receiver after a timeout.
In case the firmware generates a release right after the press, long key presses will be recognized not as repeat, but as new key presses.
In case the firmware waits, if more is coming, the release may be generated too late, because the  kernel‘s autorepeat function may have generated repeats in the meantime. This causes fake trailing keypresses.
That‘s a fundamental problem of each  keyboard remote control receiver.
These side effects can only be compensated by additional software, because linux-input is made only for real keyboards with release function.  
Many people fail to see this, and that‘s what I wanted to point out.
