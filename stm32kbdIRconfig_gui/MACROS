Chose a macro and a macroslot in "select". Put the trigger in macroslot0, e.g. with the remote control. Put the IR codes to be sent into macroslot1 et seq, again e.g. with the remote control.
If a trigger is zero (ffffffffffff) transmission will stop, and if a IR code to be sent is zero we continue at the next macro.
