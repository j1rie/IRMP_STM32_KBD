In a new eeprom and an eeprom after reset all bytes are '0xff'. That's for technical reasons, how erasing flash works.
So '0xff' means yet unwritten.

After IR reception the received IR code will be compared with all macro triggers one after the other. If a trigger is 'ffffffffffff', parsing will stop.
If the received IR code and the trigger match, the accompanying IR codes will be sent, but again at 'ffffffffffff' transmission will stop.
So 'ffffffffffff' is the stop mark for both triggers and to be sent IR codes.
This is practical, because the 'ffffffffffff's are there already at the beginning, due to the eeprom properties.
